                                            As a successor/purchaser, you shall withhold a sufficient amount of the
                                            purchase money to cover taxes, interest, or penalties due and unpaid by all
                                            former owners or predecessors, whether immediate or not, until the former
                                            owner or predecessor produce a receipt from the director of revenue showing
                                            that all taxes have been paid (a Certificate of No Tax Due or Tax
                                            Clearance); otherwise, you shall become personally liable for the unpaid
                                            tax, penalty, and interest accrued. <br><br>

                                            All purchasers have a duty to discover whether taxes are due and unpaid by
                                            any former owner or predecessor, whether immediate or not. The lack of
                                            knowledge about successorship will not relieve a purchaser from successor
                                            tax liability. Reliance on any statement or affidavit stating there were no
                                            creditors of the business, also will not relieve a purchaser from successor

                                            If you answered "yes" to any of the above questions, please obtain from the

                                            tax Certificate of No Tax due. Request the sales tax Certificate of No Tax

                                            tax. Request a Tax Clearance if the seller was responsible for collecting
