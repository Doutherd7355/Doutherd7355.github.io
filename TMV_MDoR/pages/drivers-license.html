                                            If you have been suspended because you were involved in an accident in
                                            Missouri and a judgment was rendered against you in court for failing to pay
                                            for the damages, you must send the following items to the Driver License
                                            Bureau before you can be reinstated:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>

                                                the court indicating that you have paid for the damages in full. If you
                                                do not settle (pay) the judgment, your driver license will remain

                                        If you want to update the actual driver license card that you carry in your
                                        wallet, you must apply and pay for an updated license at a Missouri license
                                        office. If you are within six months of the expiration date on your driver
                                        license, you may apply for an early renewal. If not, the transaction would be
                                        processed as a duplicate with the same expiration date as your current driver
                                        license. <br><br>

                                        Regardless of whether or not you choose to update your actual driver license,

                                        <p>To change your name, you must take documents to verify your identity, Social
                                            Security number, Missouri residency, and proof of your name change to a
                                            Missouri license office. You may then apply and pay for a duplicate driver
                                            license with your new name. Since a new signature must be "captured", a new
                                            photo may be necessary as well. If your Missouri driver license is within 6
                                            months (184 days) of expiring, you are eligible to renew your driver license
                                            early, saving you another trip to the license office.</p>

                                        <p>There are two guidelines to keep in mind regarding the grace period to renew
                                            a Missouri driver license after it has expired:</p>


                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The standard grace period to renew a Missouri driver license (without
                                                having to retest) is 6-months after the expiration date on the license.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>The grace period for an active duty military member or dependent to
                                                renew a Missouri driver license (without having to retest) is 60 days
                                                after the date of honorable discharge from the military, regardless of
                                                the expiration date on the driver license.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>
                                            However, if anybody (military or not) lets their Missouri driver license
                                            expire, that person must not drive until after renewing the driver license.

                                            If you go beyond the allowed grace period for your circumstance above, you
                                            must pass the appropriate Missouri written, vision, <a href="#">road sign
                                                recognition</a>,
                                            and skills tests at a <a href="#">Missouri State Highway Patrol examination

                                            may then apply and pay for a new Missouri driver license at any <a
