                                        wallet, you must apply and pay for an updated license at a Missouri license
                                        office. If you are within six months of the expiration date on your driver
                                        license, you may apply for an early renewal. If not, the transaction would be
                                        processed as a duplicate with the same expiration date as your current driver
                                        license. <br><br>

                                            Missouri license office. You may then apply and pay for a duplicate driver
                                            license with your new name. Since a new signature must be "captured", a new
                                            photo may be necessary as well. If your Missouri driver license is within 6
                                            months (184 days) of expiring, you are eligible to renew your driver license
