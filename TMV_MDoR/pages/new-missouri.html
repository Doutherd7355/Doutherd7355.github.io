                            <p>The Missouri Department of Revenue was created in 1945 by the Missouri Constitution to
                                serve as the central collection agency for all state revenue. The primary duties of the
                                Department are to collect taxes, title and register motor vehicles, and license drivers.
                                <br><br>

                                In 2009, the Department began the process of offering for bid all license offices,
                                eliminating the era of license office patronage in Missouri. The Department also
                                improved the functionality of the online vehicle registration system. </p>
