                                            Curbstoning is the sale of used vehicles by unlicensed dealers who pretend
                                            to be
                                            private parties in order to evade regulation. Their customers often get
                                            saddled with
                                            damaged, dangerous, or uninsurable vehicles – by which time the curbstoner
                                            is long
                                            gone with their cash. Curbstoning is illegal in many states, yet defrauds
                                            thousands
                                            of unwary consumers every year. <br><br>

                                            Automakers announced the launch of a new tool aimed at increasing consumer
                                            participation in auto recalls by allowing approved commercial and
                                            governmental entities, including state departments of motor vehicles, state
                                            vehicle registrars, state vehicle inspection programs, motor vehicle
                                            insurers, auto finance companies, motor vehicle dealers, vehicle fleet
                                            managers, automotive parts recyclers and vehicle auction companies, to
                                            search for open recalls for thousands of autos at once, free of charge. This
                                            search tool, available at <a href="#">www.freeautorecallsearch.org</a>, is a
                                            result of a
                                            partnership among the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the
                                            Association of Global Automakers – which together represent 99 percent of
                                            automakers in the United States – and Carfax, provider of vehicle
                                            history-based products trusted by buyers, sellers and owners of used cars.
                                            The search portal will allow authorized users to search for open recalls for
                                            up to 10,000 vehicles at once and get results usually within a matter of
                                            seconds. This capability is an important tool in collective, continuing
                                            efforts to increase recall participation rates. According to current Carfax
                                            research, more than 57 million vehicles on U.S. roads have unfixed recalls,
                                            despite the fact that voluntary recall remedies are completed free of charge
                                            to the consumer. <a href="#">Read more here</a>.
