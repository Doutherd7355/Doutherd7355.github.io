                                        You must pay the state sales tax AND any local taxes of the city or

                                        you live (not where you purchased the vehicle). The state sales tax
                                        rate is
                                        4.225 percent and is based on the net purchase price of your vehicle
                                        (price
                                        after rebates and trade-ins). Use the <a href="#">tax calculator</a>
                                        to estimate
                                        the amount of
                                        tax you will pay when you title and register your new vehicle.
                                        If you bought your vehicle out-of-state and paid taxes on the
                                        vehicle to that
                                        state, that tax will be credited toward the amount of tax due in
                                        Missouri. You
                                        must provide proof of the amount of tax you paid in the other state.
                                        If the
                                        amount of tax paid in the other state is less than the amount owed
                                        in Missouri,
                                        you will be assessed the difference. If the vehicle was titled in
                                        your name in
                                        another state for more than 90 days, no Missouri sales tax will be
                                        assessed.

                                        Passenger registration fees are based on the taxable horsepower

                                        different from actual engine horsepower) of your vehicle. <br><br>

                                        Truck license plates are based on the gross weight of the vehicle
                                        plus the
                                        maximum load to be carried or pulled at any one time and distance.

                                            Curbstoning is the sale of used vehicles by unlicensed dealers
                                            who pretend
                                            to be
                                            private parties in order to evade regulation. Their customers
                                            often get
                                            saddled with
                                            damaged, dangerous, or uninsurable vehicles – by which time the
                                            curbstoner
                                            is long
                                            gone with their cash. Curbstoning is illegal in many states, yet
                                            defrauds
                                            thousands
                                            of unwary consumers every year. <br><br>
