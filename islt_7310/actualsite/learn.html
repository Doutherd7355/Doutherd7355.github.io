                            As educators, a common thread that ties us together is the notion of the power we hold
                            as leaders in the second language classroom. Whether you are a pre-service instructor or
                            have been teaching for many years, most TESOL educational programs are designed to
                            elicit the understanding that the many leadership aspects we stand to inherit as
                            instructors are essential to the success of our students and classroom systems.
                            In recent times, it has become difficult not to take into account the current pressures
                            regarding the advancement and use of technology in teaching and learning. <br><br>
                            Technology can
                            play a considerable part in becoming an effective educational leader as the importance
                            and usefulness of digital literacy is becoming increasingly more widespread in student
                            engagement and learning. This article aims to assist educators in deepening their
                            understanding of what educational leadership is, how it relates to technology
                            integration in the Second Language classroom, and how we can implement leadership
                            principles through effectively integrating technology to create meaningful learning
                            ecosystems.

                                Some research has worked to establish the idea that an instructor’s beliefs about
                                technology are essential in determining the extent of technology use in the classroom
                                (e.g., Becker, 1991; Campoy, 1992; Faez & Valeo, 2012; Fisher, 1999). In TESOL contexts,
                                instructors are generally seen to be inadequately informed about technology and its
                                integration through formal contexts and are more likely informed by their workplace
                                practices and peers (Fuchs & Akbar, 2013; Kim, 2008). <br><br> Fuchs and Akbar (2013)
                                and Kim
                                (2008) illustrate their findings regarding the effects on teaching philosophies and
                                technology use in adult ESL contexts. The purpose of the study implemented by Fuchs and
                                Akbar (2013) was to “identify areas of improvement for teacher education programs with
                                regard to technology-enhanced language teaching and student teachers' professional
                                development” (p.157). The researchers asked questions regarding what kind of prior
                                technology experience and training Intensive English Program pre-service teachers
                                received, how important they considered technology implementation in their language
                                teaching, how they rated their proficiency in using technology tools, and how often they
                                used these tools in teaching. The results showed that more than half of respondents had
                                either a negative view of classroom technology use or a basic view of technology use
                                that did not fully align with expert established integration practices. <br><br>
                                Meanwhile, Kim
                                (2008) suggests that the use of computers in the classrooms of ESL instructors varies
                                depending on the teachers’ individual perceptions and expectations of computers. The
                                study aimed to explain technology perception of L2 instructors, expectations for
                                Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) integration, and thoughts about CALL
                                integration assisting language learning for students. The findings of the study discuss
                                that participants typically viewed technology integration in their classrooms
                                positively. However, as also seen in Fuchs and Akbar (2013), their ideas of technology
                                integration were not consistent with what CALL literature defines as effective
                                technology integration. Namely, the approach to teaching using technology was often
                                opposite to those expertly considered more effective.

                                In the realm of Second Language instruction, many studies have noted that technology
                                assisted classrooms are viewed to be inherently different from face-to-face traditional
                                instruction (Churn, 2016; Egbert, Paulus, & Nakamichi, 2002; Hubbard, 2018; Hannafin &
                                Land, 1997; Levy, 1996;). Primarily, this difference has been noted as relating to
                                student-centered (focus on student learning) and teacher-centered (focus on instructor
                                teaching) styles.
                                Some researchers inform the literature regarding student-centered and traditional
                                teacher-centered philosophies plainly asserting that teacher-centered beliefs do not
                                facilitate successful computer integration (Miller & Olsen, 1994; Wang, 2002). Others
                                seem to concur by asserting that successful integration of technology requires a
                                philosophical adjustment from a teacher-centered style to a student-centered style which
                                garners very different decision-making practices for instructors (Pedersen & Liu, 2003;
                                Sandholtz, Ringstaff, & Dwyer, 1997).
                                The difference between Teacher-Centered (a.k.a. Traditional) instruction and Student
                                Centered instruction is significant. An example of the difference in an instructors
                                decision making process within these two approaches can be explored below.

                                student-centered instructional role by facilitating instruction when integrating
                                technology into their classrooms (Meskill, Mossop, & Bates, 1999; Norton & Gonzales,
                                1998). However, as mentioned previously, these self perceptions did not always hold up
                                in practice. In other words, instructors may, for some reason or another, lack
                                self-awareness by self-identifying as student-centered in their teaching approach, but
                                exemplify a teacher-centered approach in actual practice.
                                With that said, instructors were also more likely to welcome and adjust to the ambiguity
                                of successful integration, as well as utilize opportunities to learn more information to
                                integrate technology more smoothly and effectively into their classrooms (Berg, Benz,
                                Lasley, & Raisch, 1998). However, Strudler and Jones (1999) remark that inexperienced
                                and experienced instructors both utilize technology in ways that correspond with their
                                current philosophies at play, rather than transforming their practice using technology.
                                Kagan (1992) further notes that instructors who were overall inexperienced at teaching
                                encountered more impactful effects caused by the ambiguity of integration. In other
                                words, depending on experience level, instructors may not feel as free to integrate
                                technology into their classrooms and therefore can focus more on teacher-centered
                                developmental stages such as those described by Gatbonton (1999). <br><br>
                                Gatbonton (1999) finds that the pedagogical choices of experienced ESL instructors are
                                often guided by common specific patterns of mental acts revolving around the following:
                                a) Language Management (making sure students are producing and receiving correct
                                language input), b) Student Knowledge (making sure students have accurate information
                                regarding language), c) Procedure Check (making sure lessons are unfolding as planned),
                                and d) Progress Review (making sure students remember or use certain language features).
                                Meskill, Mossop, DiAngelo, and Pasquale (2002) who stated in a comparable study “What is
                                fairly well understood is that experienced teachers who use technologies effectively
                                with their students can be broadly characterized as viewing technology as a means rather
                                than an end to learning” (p. 46). This suggests that while experienced technology
                                integrators are student-centered, inexperienced instructors are well understood to be
                                oppositely teacher centered. <br><br>
                                The practice of either approach may impact measurable
                                stages of teacher development and process.
                                Similarly, in more recent ESL contexts, instructors who have shown some experience with
                                technology integration were seen to utilize more tool variation, integrate more
                                authentic materials, and engage students more technologically. However, most
                                interactions with technology in these groups are limited to lesson planning over actual
                                technology integration (Fuchs & Akbar, 2013; Kim, 2008). Thus, suggesting that
                                instructors may still err more toward a teacher-centered approach by attending more to
                                the concrete “Procedure Check” element of teaching rather than what students could do
                                themselves with technology to learn.

                                    The TESOL International Association framework is substantial and even contains
                                    examples
                                    of what instructors can do to implement each of the goals in a classroom
                                    environment.
                                    While very useful, there is a danger in focusing so heavily on what instructors
                                    <em>can
                                        do</em>

                                    goals. This focus can be interpreted as too heavily assuming that the scenarios
                                    present
                                    in the examples will be
                                    universal across all contexts. Thus, it leaves too much burden on the language
                                    instructor to abstract each example to fit their own living context. This can lead
                                    to
                                    serious implications in the actual standardized practice of the listed goals in the

                                    What the framework seemingly fails to do is offer insight into how instructors

                                    So, how should we think as technology leaders in the TESOL field? The answer this

                                With the framework of technology integration standards in the TESOL field in mind, this
                                article suggests that there are two main ways that technology integration can show up in
                                TESOL classrooms. Teacher-Centered Meaningful Technology Integration is the utilization
                                of technology in a way that directly impacts instructional practices. Student-Centered
                                Meaningful Learning is the use of technology in a way that directly impacts student
                                learning within a classroom environment. Both integration types are critical in the
                                successful and effective leadership of technology integration in TESOL classrooms.
                                However, the difference between them is critical to understand for creating well-rounded
                                integrated environments.

                                Meaningful technology integration can be appropriately teacher-centered. This article
                                asserts that student-centered teaching is essential to the meaningful learning of an L2,
                                but it does not aim to promote the thinking that all use of technology in a classroom
                                must directly benefit students. Thus, it is important to note the distinction between
                                appropriately teacher-centered technology integration and inappropriately teacher
                                centered technology integration. <br><br>
                                <strong>Appropriate:</strong>
                                1. “I will make a course website for students to explore for this assignment because I
                                can control the resources, and it will be easier for me to grade. Additionally, I won’t
                                need to spend a lot of time that I don’t have teaching advanced research skills to this
                                lower level class.” <br><br>
                                <strong>Inappropriate</strong>
                                2. “I will make this assignment into an interactive online module. I want to practice my
                                skills with this new software I found. It is really popular, and if I need a new job, I
                                can put it on my resume to stand out as a candidate.” <br><br>

                                Adult instructional design experts Larson and Lockee (2014) state that technology should
                                always be used to support specific instructional needs (p.184). In a classroom system,
                                the teacher-centered need for classroom productivity and management technology tools is
                                logical for the success of the system. Thus, tools that enable easy grade tracking and
                                content management for example directly impact the instructor’s time and actions, but
                                also benefit the system as a whole, and the students indirectly. <br><br>

                                Similarly, Howland et al. (2012) state that a valid form of technology integration is as
                                an information vehicle to support learning construction via accessing information needed
                                to complete assignments. They also clearly stipulate that in using technology “Knowledge
                                cannot be delivered. Information can.”(pg. ). This article does not contest that
                                information is one of the most important elements to the successful implementation of
                                higher-level thinking assignments and learning. Therefore, utilizing technology to
                                simply present information can absolutely be a valid pedagogical choice throughout some
                                contexts in the TESOL field when used in tandem with other meaningful tasks. This is
                                especially pertinent in review and resource content. <br><br>

                                However, utilizing technology to present information without consideration to how it
                                affects students and why it is being done is less valid. A critical message from Larson
                                and Lockee (2014) states that learners can always recognize when technology is used
                                without significant meaning to them. This can easily cause resentment toward technology
                                and the instructors who insist on implementing it. (pg. 185).

                            <p class="justify">
                                Technology integration that directly impacts instructors is centered around the idea of
                                meaningful integration. Technology integration that directly impacts student’s is more
                                centered around the idea of meaningful learning. <br><br>

                                According to Howland et al. (2012) learning is motivated by understanding and persisting
                                on a task or activity. Tasks are meaningful when they require certain cognitive and
                                behavioral acts. Namely, “Tasks are meaningful when they require intentional, active,
                                constructive, cooperative, and authentic learning” (p.2). Understanding exactly what
                                these features mean is crucial to conceptualizing meaningful technology use. <br><br>

                                First, <strong>active learning</strong> is manipulative and observant. When a student is
                                actively engaged
                                in a task, they are challenged to interact and experiment with features and rules of the
                                task that are critical to real-life implementation. While this feature is crucial in the
                                make-up of a meaningful task, it cannot stand alone. <br><br>
                                <strong>Constructive learning</strong> encourages articulation and reflection via
                                challenge and
                                ambiguity. When a student is engaged in a constructive task, they are consumed in
                                expressing accomplishments and are reflective about what they have learned from the task
                                and their observations of it. <br><br>
                                <strong>Constructive learning</strong> is goal-directed and well-managed. When a student
                                is
                                engaged in an
                                intentional activity, they are purposefully attempting to achieve a goal. Because
                                students are deliberately trying to fulfil an intention, thinking and learning around
                                that goal increases. <br><br>
                                <strong>Authentic learning</strong> is complex and contextual. Students are engaged in
                                authentic
                                tasks,
                                they are able to take the constructions they make from the task and use them in
                                meaningful real-world or simulated environments. Students can consistently transfer
                                items learned in an authentic task to a variety of new situations. <br><br>
                                Lastly, <strong>cooperative learning</strong> is collaborative and conversational.
                                Students work
                                together
                                to build knowledge through communal meaning-making. Students take advantage of one
                                anothers skills and understandings and use them to solve problems and perform tasks.
                                <br><br>

                                Overall, the Howland et al. (2012) assert that meaningful learning is interrelated,
                                interactive, and independent. It should be born from combinations of the above types of
                                learning. Below, you will find one scenario of technology integration in the Second
                                Language
                                classroom. Each of the scenarios will exemplify a non-meaningful use of technology and a
                                meaningful use of technology. Read both and try to determine which is the meaningful
                                scenario based on the elements of meaningful learning listed above. An explanation of
                                how the integration practices align with
                                the elements of meaningful learning will also be provided later in the article.

                                Intensive English Program, an instructor attempts to integrate technology
                                into the lesson by designing a Google Slide deck on the topic. On his first
                                slide, he includes a 5 minute youtube video about the subject. After
                                presenting the video to the class, the teacher moves to the second slide
                                where he has listed four grammar exercises regarding the topic which he does
                                with his students as a group. He moves to the third slide where he has
                                placed four more exercises which he instructs his students to do on their
                                own. After a period of time, he instructs his students to briefly share
                                their answers. Then, he walks the class through each exercise one at a time
                                asking for volunteered answers from the audience. After a few students speak
                                up, he offers detailed explanations regarding the correct answers.

                                <h4>Scenario 2</h4>
                                During a grammar lesson on articles in a level B1 Grammar & Composition
                                course at an Intensive English Program, an instructor attempts to integrate
                                technology into the lesson by designing a video project. The instructor
                                begins by sharing an online instruction document for the assignment on the
                                class learning management system. For this project, groups of three must
                                create a 2-3 minute video using the software Stop Motion Studio. In the
                                video an inanimate object of their choice introduces itself and gives a tour
                                of a freely accessible room or section of the school or other close and
                                easily accessible space. Alternatively, students can offer a tour of an
                                imaginary space created by the group as a series of drawings. For the
                                content of the video, groups must focus on what the tour guide in their
                                video (narrated by a group member) will say. Before they start filming their
                                video, groups must use an online document to produce a script which contains
                                a written description of the scenes they plan to film and a complete script
                                in full sentences with the target feature clearly identified with color
                                highlighting. The instructor encourages groups to help each other use the
                                correct articles in their scripts by appropriating group member knowledge,
                                research from the internet via links provided on the instruction document,
                                and --as a fallback-- the instructor. Groups in the class will be assigned
                                to approve each other's scripts before a group can begin filming (as an
                                extended homework assignment). When products have been completed, each group
                                will showcase their work to the class who will discuss the most interesting
                                features of the videos.

                                Scenario 1: Non-Meaningful Technology Integration Example. Explanation: The technology
                                integration in the above scenario is more
                                meaningful than the scenario before it. Firstly, the learning is active.
                                Students are challenged to create a product where they must manipulate their
                                knowledge of article use in a product of their own. The task is constructive
                                as students are presented with ample opportunity to construct their
                                understanding of article use by talking about and reflecting on challenges
                                and observations of the task. The project is intentional in that the
                                instructor has provided a well-managed, easily accessible instruction
                                document which clearly states the goals of the assignment students are
                                expected to meet upon successful completion of the task. Furthermore, the
                                task is authentic by being complex and contextual. Students will be able to
                                take the language constructions they generate from the task and use them in
                                other similar and new situations. Finally, the task is highly cooperative
                                because it includes a large number of opportunities for students to work
                                together to build knowledge through communal meaning-making and taking
                                advantage of one anothers skills and knowledge.Although this scenario does include
                                technology use, the
                                implementation of integration is lacking the elements that comprise
                                meaningfulness. Students are not challenged to be active by interacting and
                                experimenting with aspects and rules of the target language feature. They
                                are not encouraged to reflect on their accomplishments within the technology
                                facilitated task, nor do they converse about their ideas regarding the task
                                in any significant way. The task is intentional in the sense that it aims to
                                intentionally cover a specific grammar feature, but students are not
                                specifically asked to purposefully attempt to achieve a goal. The
                                authenticity of the task in the scenario is dependent on the goals of the
                                lesson which weren’t specified. If the goal for this course is for students
                                to learn how to answer grammar exercises about article use for testing
                                purposes, then this scenario could be counted as authentic. However, if the
                                goal of the course is to encourage more accurate and fluent spoken English
                                overall, the task is not authentic because it does not align with the goals
                                of the course. Finally, the task is not collaborative or conversational.
                                Students are asked to share their answers from an individually taken test;
                                however, this is not collaborative or conversational as much as it is likely
                                students simply reading their answers to one another.

                                Scenario 2: Meaningful Technology Integration Example. The technology integration in the
                                above scenario is more
                                meaningful than the scenario before it. Firstly, the learning is active.
                                Students are challenged to create a product where they must manipulate their
                                knowledge of article use in a product of their own. The task is constructive
                                as students are presented with ample opportunity to construct their
                                understanding of article use by talking about and reflecting on challenges
                                and observations of the task. The project is intentional in that the
                                instructor has provided a well-managed, easily accessible instruction
                                document which clearly states the goals of the assignment students are
                                expected to meet upon successful completion of the task. Furthermore, the
                                task is authentic by being complex and contextual. Students will be able to
                                take the language constructions they generate from the task and use them in
                                other similar and new situations. Finally, the task is highly cooperative
                                because it includes a large number of opportunities for students to work
                                together to build knowledge through communal meaning-making and taking
                                advantage of one anothers skills and knowledge.

                                Howland et al. (2012) go on to assert a final important element of meaningful learning
                                which is essential to successfully combining meaningful learning with technology
                                integration. They insist that meaningful learning engages students to “learn with
                                technology, not from it” (p.5). The implications of this statement relate directly to
                                the assertion that successful technology integration in classrooms is student-centered
                                rather than teacher-centered because of the primary impact on student learning. However,
                                successful technology integration is not simply limited to student-centered meaningful
                                learning. TESOL educators must think about how to use technology to facilitate learning
                                in students and how to utilize technology for classroom management and job productivity
                                as well. <br><br>

                                Now that we have discussed what constitutes meaningful learning. We will explore how to
                                evaluate the implementation of technology in assignments.

                                learned, requires a student-centered approach and a meaningful focus. Generating or
                                selecting assignments to integrate technology into for use in the classroom can be quite
                                difficult. There is a lot to consider in reference to how and why the technology needs
                                to be implemented at all. In order to begin evaluating technology integration in your
                                classroom, you must know exactly what your classroom context is trying to accomplish in
                                terms of goals and objectives. <br><br>

                                Bloom's Taxonomy is often used by instructors to set the goals and objectives of a
                                classroom environment. However, it can also be used to organize the purposes and
                                expectations of individual assignments. The higher up on the hierarchy, the more complex

                            <p class="justify">
                                The SAMR model was developed by Dr. Ruben Puentedura (2014). The model is described as
                                “a way for instructors to evaluate how they integrate technology into their teaching”.
                                It was built on the principle that instructors are facilitators who encourage students
                                to take ownership of their education. <br><br>
                                The module consists of four steps that represent increasing complexity in how technology
                                is utilized in the classroom.


                                <img class="img-resize-down" src="./resources/SAMR.jpg" alt="SAMR Model">

                                The model is divided into two sections. The <strong>Enhancement</strong> tier of the
                                model deals with substitution and augmentation. Enhancement
                                elements are simple and concrete. They do not require higher-level thought processes
                                like critical thinking, problem solving, and synthesizing. <br><br>

                                In simple terms, <strong>Substitution</strong> of technology acts to enhance learning by
                                replacing
                                another mode of instruction. Imagine you are teaching a Listening & Speaking ESL course,
                                and you want to encourage your students to learn new vocabulary and phrases. Each week,
                                you assign a worksheet where students write down 1-2 new words or phrases they recently
                                learned and submit it at the beginning of the next class. Instead of passing out a paper
                                worksheet, you send out a Google Docs template for students to fill out and submit. In
                                doing this, you are now integrating technology by substitution. Despite the fact that
                                you are using technology, there is no real change in how the information is recorded or
                                the complexity by which it is presented or recorded from paper worksheet to digital
                                worksheet. However, learning is enhanced because students can revisit their copies of
                                this work and interact with it whenever they wish. <br><br>
                                Next, <strong>Augmentation</strong> is the step in the model that incorporates
                                substitution, but requires a
                                higher level change in the function of technology and allows for the expanding of the
                                information. Let’s say you now require students to use more features in the Google Doc
                                rather than just writing text. Now, you require students to incorporate related imagery
                                to their word(s) or phrase(s) by uploading pictures. You also want them to utilize text
                                coloring and highlighting features to represent which word families the recorded
                                vocabulary words belong to. In this way, not only is the technology being used to record
                                the students’ work, it is being used to enhance productivity by providing tools students
                                can use to efficiently complete the assignment with success. Learning is enhanced
                                because students are given the opportunity to understand more information about the new
                                words and phrases than they may have been able to by completing the same assignment
                                without the technology.

                                The transformation tier of the model deals with modification and redefinition.
                                Transformation elements are complex and abstract. They do require higher-level thought
                                processes like critical thinking, problem solving, and synthesizing. Additionally, they
                                often encourage collaboration and student ownership of assignments. <br><br>

                                <strong>Modification</strong> is performed when the technology being integrated
                                significantly changes the
                                way a task is performed or thought about. Using the same new vocabulary and phrases
                                assignment, you might --for example-- now require groups of students complete their
                                assignment on a shared document where they are then asked to generate a brief informal
                                discussion using the comments function about the words recorded by each group member.
                                Students may be encouraged to share their own personal or cultural experiences with the
                                word, their personal thoughts about the word or phrase. They might also inquire about
                                peer perceptions or understandings of the word or phrase. Overall, students are no
                                longer completing the assignment with an individualized focus on the information. The
                                introduction of collaborative tools to incorporate student voice completely changes the
                                way the assignment is executed. Learning is enhanced because students can incorporate
                                and construct different perspectives into their understanding of the content. <br><br>

                                <strong>Redefinition</strong> requires students to create by thinking about and
                                understanding projects in
                                completely new ways usually with a bigger audience than the immediate classroom
                                environment in mind. For example, you might have students select 5 words and/or phrases
                                from the lists they have accumulated. Then, task groups of students create a five
                                episode language podcast where they take turns formally interviewing native speakers
                                about the words or phrases to gain more perspectives and insight into how they are used
                                (i.e. formality, frequency, meaning, etc) and personal experiences or stories with the
                                words and phrases. Students must not only perform the interviews for their podcasts,
                                they must define what the episode structure will involve in terms of questions asked and
                                interview flow. Redefining this assignment means students are actively creating in ways
                                that the original assignment would have never allowed. Learning is enhanced because
                                students are using a number of different skills such as communication and critical
                                thinking to generate a deeper understanding of the target feature.

                                If you want more information and examples of how SAMR can be used to conceptualize

                                Bloom's Taxonomy and the SAMR Model can be used in tandem to identify and conceptualize
                                exactly how technology integration aligns with course and assignment goals and
                                objectives. As seen in the image below, Bloom’s Taxonomy can be split into the same two
                                tiers as the SAMR model to create six more detailed definitions of how to evaluate and
                                create technology integration in classrooms.

                                Augmentation. The Transformation tier of the SAMR aligns with Analyze, Evaluate, and
                                Create - the more abstract and complex elements on Bloom’s Taxonomy.

                                Technology leadership in TESOL requires more than simply knowing what the industry goals
                                and standards regarding technology integration are. Rather, it is knowing how to think
                                with the standards in mind that takes you from a beginning leader to a transformative
                                one. As TESOL educators, being “Transformative” means to innovate. This article
