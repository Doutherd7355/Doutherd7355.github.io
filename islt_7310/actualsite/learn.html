                            As educators, a common thread that ties us together is the notion of the power we hold
                            as leaders in the second language classroom. Whether you are a pre-service instructor or
                            have been teaching for many years, most TESOL educational programs are designed to
                            elicit the understanding that the many leadership aspects we stand to inherit as
                            instructors are essential to the success of our students and classroom systems.
                            In recent times, it has become difficult not to take into account the current pressures
                            regarding the advancement and use of technology in teaching and learning. <br><br>
                            Technology can
                            play a considerable part in becoming an effective educational leader as the importance
                            and usefulness of digital literacy is becoming increasingly more widespread in student
                            engagement and learning. This article aims to assist educators in deepening their
                            understanding of what educational leadership is, how it relates to technology
                            integration in the Second Language classroom, and how we can implement leadership
                            principles through effectively integrating technology to create meaningful learning
                            ecosystems.

                                Some research has worked to establish the idea that an instructor’s beliefs about
                                technology are essential in determining the extent of technology use in the classroom
                                (e.g., Becker, 1991; Campoy, 1992; Faez & Valeo, 2012; Fisher, 1999). In TESOL contexts,
                                instructors are generally seen to be inadequately informed about technology and its
                                integration through formal contexts and are more likely informed by their workplace
                                practices and peers (Fuchs & Akbar, 2013; Kim, 2008). <br><br> Fuchs and Akbar (2013)
                                and Kim
                                (2008) illustrate their findings regarding the effects on teaching philosophies and
                                technology use in adult ESL contexts. The purpose of the study implemented by Fuchs and
                                Akbar (2013) was to “identify areas of improvement for teacher education programs with
                                regard to technology-enhanced language teaching and student teachers' professional
                                development” (p.157). The researchers asked questions regarding what kind of prior
                                technology experience and training Intensive English Program pre-service teachers
                                received, how important they considered technology implementation in their language
                                teaching, how they rated their proficiency in using technology tools, and how often they
                                used these tools in teaching. The results showed that more than half of respondents had
                                either a negative view of classroom technology use or a basic view of technology use
                                that did not fully align with expert established integration practices. <br><br>
                                Meanwhile, Kim
                                (2008) suggests that the use of computers in the classrooms of ESL instructors varies
                                depending on the teachers’ individual perceptions and expectations of computers. The
                                study aimed to explain technology perception of L2 instructors, expectations for
                                Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) integration, and thoughts about CALL
                                integration assisting language learning for students. The findings of the study discuss
                                that participants typically viewed technology integration in their classrooms
                                positively. However, as also seen in Fuchs and Akbar (2013), their ideas of technology
                                integration were not consistent with what CALL literature defines as effective
                                technology integration. Namely, the approach to teaching using technology was often
                                opposite to those expertly considered more effective.

                            <p class="justify">
                                In the realm of Second Language instruction, many studies have noted that technology
                                assisted classrooms are viewed to be inherently different from face-to-face traditional
                                instruction (Churn, 2016; Egbert, Paulus, & Nakamichi, 2002; Hubbard, 2018; Hannafin &
                                Land, 1997; Levy, 1996;). Primarily, this difference has been noted as relating to
                                student-centered (focus on student learning) and teacher-centered (focus on instructor
                                teaching) styles.
                                Some researchers inform the literature regarding student-centered and traditional
                                teacher-centered philosophies plainly asserting that teacher-centered beliefs do not
                                facilitate successful computer integration (Miller & Olsen, 1994; Wang, 2002). Others
                                seem to concur by asserting that successful integration of technology requires a
                                philosophical adjustment from a teacher-centered style to a student-centered style which
                                garners very different decision-making practices for instructors (Pedersen & Liu, 2003;
                                Sandholtz, Ringstaff, & Dwyer, 1997).
                                The difference between Teacher-Centered (a.k.a. Traditional) instruction and Student
                                Centered instruction is significant. An example of the difference in an instructors
                                decision making process within these two approaches can be explored below.

                                Studies show that L2 instructors generally conceptualize themselves more in line with a
                                student-centered instructional role by facilitating instruction when integrating
                                technology into their classrooms (Meskill, Mossop, & Bates, 1999; Norton & Gonzales,
                                1998). However, as mentioned previously, these self perceptions did not always hold up
                                in practice. In other words, instructors may, for some reason or another, lack
                                self-awareness by self-identifying as student-centered in their teaching approach, but
                                exemplify a teacher-centered approach in actual practice.
                                With that said, instructors were also more likely to welcome and adjust to the ambiguity
                                of successful integration, as well as utilize opportunities to learn more information to
                                integrate technology more smoothly and effectively into their classrooms (Berg, Benz,
                                Lasley, & Raisch, 1998). However, Strudler and Jones (1999) remark that inexperienced
                                and experienced instructors both utilize technology in ways that correspond with their
                                current philosophies at play, rather than transforming their practice using technology.
                                Kagan (1992) further notes that instructors who were overall inexperienced at teaching
                                encountered more impactful effects caused by the ambiguity of integration. In other
                                words, depending on experience level, instructors may not feel as free to integrate
                                technology into their classrooms and therefore can focus more on teacher-centered
                                developmental stages such as those described by Gatbonton (1999). <br><br>
                                Gatbonton (1999) finds that the pedagogical choices of experienced ESL instructors are
                                often guided by common specific patterns of mental acts revolving around the following:
                                a) Language Management (making sure students are producing and receiving correct
                                language input), b) Student Knowledge (making sure students have accurate information
                                regarding language), c) Procedure Check (making sure lessons are unfolding as planned),
                                and d) Progress Review (making sure students remember or use certain language features).
                                Meskill, Mossop, DiAngelo, and Pasquale (2002) who stated in a comparable study “What is
                                fairly well understood is that experienced teachers who use technologies effectively
                                with their students can be broadly characterized as viewing technology as a means rather
                                than an end to learning” (p. 46). This suggests that while experienced technology
                                integrators are student-centered, inexperienced instructors are well understood to be
                                oppositely teacher centered. <br><br>
                                The practice of either approach may impact measurable
                                stages of teacher development and process.
                                Similarly, in more recent ESL contexts, instructors who have shown some experience with
                                technology integration were seen to utilize more tool variation, integrate more
                                authentic materials, and engage students more technologically. However, most
                                interactions with technology in these groups are limited to lesson planning over actual
                                technology integration (Fuchs & Akbar, 2013; Kim, 2008). Thus, suggesting that
                                instructors may still err more toward a teacher-centered approach by attending more to
                                the concrete “Procedure Check” element of teaching rather than what students could do
                                themselves with technology to learn.

                                In 2008, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) developed a rubric
                                scale detailing the different expectations regarding technology integration for a
                                variety of experience levels. The rubric begins with the “Beginning level” and ends with
                                the “Transformative level”.
                                • The Beginning level teacher is a beginner in the use of technology tools and his or

                                • The Proficient level teacher is one who uses technology tools effectively in the
                                improvement of student learning.
                                • The Transformative level teacher uses technology tools in collaboration with the

                                In the same year, the TESOL International Association outlined <a href="#">a framework
                                    for
                                    technology integration standards</a> which build on the NETS standards established

                                This framework outlines specifications for technology integration goals, models, and
                                performance indicators for instructors and students in the language learning field.
                                The main goals:

                                <li>Goal 3. Language teachers apply technology in record-keeping, feedback, and

                                The TESOL International Association framework is substantial and even contains examples
                                of what instructors can do to implement each of the goals in a classroom environment.
                                While very useful, there is a danger in focusing so heavily on what instructors <em>can
                                    do</em>
                                to meet the
                                goals. This focus can be interpreted as too heavily assuming that the scenarios present
                                in the examples will be
                                universal across all contexts. Thus, it leaves too much burden on the language
                                instructor to abstract each example to fit their own living context. This can lead to
                                serious implications in the actual standardized practice of the listed goals in the
                                framework.
                                What the framework seemingly fails to do is offer insight into how instructors
                                <em>should think</em> as technology
                                integrators. <br><br>
                                So, how should we think as technology leaders in the TESOL field? The answer this
                                article proposes is to practice the process of thinking about the
                                <strong>meaningfulness</strong> of
                                technology integration in one’s classroom.

                            <p class="justify">
                                According to Howland et al. (2012) learning is motivated by understanding and persisting
                                on a task or activity. Tasks are meaningful when they require certain cognitive and
                                behavioral acts. Namely, “Tasks are meaningful when they require intentional, active,
                                constructive, cooperative, and authentic learning” (p.2). Understanding exactly what
                                these features mean is crucial to conceptualizing meaningful technology use. <br><br>
                                First, active learning is manipulative and observant. When a student is actively engaged
                                in a task, they are challenged to interact and experiment with features and rules of the
                                task that are critical to real-life implementation. While this feature is crucial in the
                                make-up of a meaningful task, it cannot stand alone. <br><br>
                                Constructive learning encourages articulation and reflection via challenge and
                                ambiguity. When a student is engaged in a constructive task, they are consumed in
                                expressing accomplishments and are reflective about what they have learned from the task
                                and their observations of it. <br><br>
                                Intentional learning is goal-directed and well-managed. When a student is engaged in an
                                intentional activity, they are purposefully attempting to achieve a goal. Because
                                students are deliberately trying to fulfil an intention, thinking and learning around
                                that goal increases. <br><br>
                                Authentic learning is complex and contextual. Students are engaged in authentic tasks,
                                they are able to take the constructions they make from the task and use them in
                                meaningful real-world or simulated environments. Students can consistently transfer
                                items learned in an authentic task to a variety of new situations. <br><br>
                                Lastly, cooperative learning is collaborative and conversational. Students work together
                                to build knowledge through communal meaning-making. Students take advantage of one
                                anothers skills and understandings and use them to solve problems and perform tasks.
                                Overall, the Howland et al. assert that meaningful learning is interrelated,
                                interactive, and independent. It should be born from combinations of the above types of
                                learning.
                                Howland et al. (2012) go on to assert a few more important elements of meaningful
                                learning which are important to understand specifically when combining meaningful
                                learning with technology integration.
                                Meaningful learning engages students to “learn with technology, not from it” (p.5).
                                “Knowledge cannot be delivered. Information can.”

                                Implementing technology into your Second Language classroom, as we have learned, is not
                                about picking something that you like or which you think will be fun for students.
                                Selecting technology for use in the classroom can be quite difficult as there is a lot
                                to consider in reference to how and why the technology needs to be implemented at all.
